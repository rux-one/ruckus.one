As a programmer who has fond memories of pen & paper coding exams, I've witnessed the progression of my programming environment. 

Everyone's journey was most likely different but in my case:
- 𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗱 and 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲::𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝘀 in labs - fascination on the topic made it bearable
- 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝘁𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗼 and 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗧𝗲𝘅𝘁 in early career - more powerful tools, commands & plugins
- 𝗩𝗦𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 for the past 7 years - quick, flexible, reliable
- 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗿 and 𝗪𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗳 - ...currently evaluating

GenAI has revolutionised coding, making features like multi-select and context chat indispensable.

What if one day you need to make a dirty change over SSH? I could not be bothered to set up the whole toolchain. Small change on a small raspberry board? Same.

It appears crucial to [maintain proficiency in basic tools](https://rux.one/2024/11/25/Learning-vim-proper/) for situations where advanced options aren't available.
