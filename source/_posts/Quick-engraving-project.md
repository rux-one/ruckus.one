I am a simple person, I see a funny picture and I want it on my wall.

Aaand it's done. Engraved & stained. 

Although the picture is not very applicable anymore, this reminds me that with great power comes... great something. :thinkhappy: 

Also it goes nicely with ...some other... wooden beauties in the office. 

I was trying to find out who made the design but it appears royalty-free on Vecteezy (hopefully).
