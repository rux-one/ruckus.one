Very crude, but apparently functional. It has already helped me homebrewing my very first batch of beer. 
The idea is very much the same as in the travel fridges - recycled Peltier cells.

When it goes on a deserved break I am going to add some very-needed improvements:
- probably use some MCU to better drive the cooling & fans
- work on insulation & power efficiency
- it's screaming for some cable management (you don't say)
