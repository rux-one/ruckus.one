The day has come I felt an urge to learn Vim properly.

Here are some ways to go about it I found so far, graded by the level of fun and effectiveness:

✅ built-in vim tutor (:Tutor command) -> hardly exciting, very effective

✅ "Vim adventures" game -> fun, effective but also paid

✅ VimHero (below) -> somewhat fun, appears effective

✅ Vim plugin for your IDE (e.g. vscode) -> not exactly fun but so far the best way to do practical learning while still being productive in a familiar environment

I have been challenging myself to use it daily for all sort of projects, whether it's private or work related. Let's see how it goes for the next few weeks.
